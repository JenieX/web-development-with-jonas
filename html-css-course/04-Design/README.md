## Design Ingredients

These rules wil be divided into 10 different areas of web design, each area will have its own many rules. These rules can be applied to any website based on something that we will call the website personality.

### 1. Typography

- USE GOOD **TYPEFACES**

  - Use only **good** and popular **typefaces** and play it safe
  - It’s okay to use just **one typeface** per page! If you want more, limit to 2 typefaces
  - Choose the **right typeface** according to your website personality

- USE GOOD FONT **SIZE AND WEIGHT**

  - When choosing font-sizes, limit choices! Use a “type scale” tool or other **pre-defined range**
  - Use a font size **between 16px and 32px** for “normal” text
  - For **long text** (like a blog post), try a size of **20px or even bigger**
  - For **headlines**, you can go really big **(50px+)** and bold **(600+)**, depending on personality
  - For any text, **don’t use a font weight under 400** (regular)

- CREATE A GOOD **READING EXPERIENCE**

  - Use less than **75 characters per line**
  - For **normal-sized text**, use a **line height between 1.5 and 2**. For **big text**, go **below 1.5**
  - **Decrease letter spacing in headlines**, if it looks unnatural (this will come from experience)
  - Experiment with all **caps for short titles**. Make them **small** and **bold** and **increase letter-spacing**
  - Usually, **don’t justify text**
  - **Don’t center long text** blocks. Small blocks are fine

### 2. Colors

- CHOOSE THE **RIGHT COLOR**

  - Make the main color **match your website’s personality**: colors convey meaning!
    - `red` is to draws the most attention, and symbolizes power, passion, and excitement.
    - `orange` is less aggressive, it symbolizes happiness, cheerfulness, and creativity.
    - `yellow` means joy, brightness, and intelligence.
    - `green` represents nature, growth, and health,
    - `blue` is associated with peace, trustworthiness, and professionalism.
    - `purple` conveys wealth, wisdom, and also magic.
    - `pink` represent romance, care, and affection.
    - `brown` represents nature, comfort, and durability.
    - `black` symbolizes power like Red, elegance and minimalism. It also shows grief and sorrow.
  - Use a **good color tone!** Don’t choose a random tone or CSS named colors.

- ESTABLISH A COLOR **SYSTEM**

  - You need at least two types of colors in your color palette: a **main color** and a **grey color**
  - With more experience, you can add more colors: **accent (secondary) color** (use a tool)
  - For diversity, create lighter and darker “versions” (**tints** and **shades**)

- **WHEN AND HOW** TO USE COLORS

  - Use your **main color to draw attention** to the most important elements on the page
  - Use colors to add **interesting accents** or make **entire components or sections** stand out
  - You can try to **use your color strategically** in images and illustrations

- COLORS AND **TYPOGRAPHY**

  - On **dark colored backgrounds**, try to **use a tint** of the background (“lighter version”) for text
  - Text should usually **not** be completely **black**. Lighten if up it looks heavy and uninviting
  - **Don’t make text too light!** Use a tool to check contrast between text and background colors
    - Contrast ratio needs to be at least **4.5:1 for normal text** and **3:1 for large text** (18px+)

### 3. Images/Illustrations

- USE **GOOD IMAGES**

  - Different types of images: **product** photos, **storytelling** photos, **illustrations**, **patterns**
  - Use images to support your website’s message and story. So only use **relevant images!**
  - Prefer **original images**. If not possible, use original-looking stock images (not generic ones!)

- **USE** IMAGES **WELL**

  - Try to show **real people** to trigger user’s emotions
  - If necessary, **crop images** to fit your message
  - Experiment **combining** photos, illustrations and patterns

- HANDLING **TEXT** ON IMAGES

  - Method #1: **Darker or brighten image** (completely or partially, using a gradient)
  - Method #2: Position text into **neutral image area**
  - Method #3: Put **text in a box**

- SOME **TECHNICAL DETAILS**

  - To account for high-res screens, make image dimensions **2x as big** as their displayed size
  - **Compress images** for a lower file size and better performance
  - When using multiple **images side-by-side**, make sure they **have the exact same dimensions**

### 4. Icons

- USE **GOOD ICONS**

  - Use a **good icon pack**, there are tons of free and paid icons packs
  - Use only **one icon pack**. Don’t mix icons from different icon packs
  - Use **SVG icons or icon fonts**. Don’t use bitmap image formats (.jpg and .png)!
  - **Adjust to website personality!** Roundness, weight and filled/outlined **depend on typography**

- **WHEN** TO USE ICONS

  - Use icons to provide **visual assistance to text**
  - Use icons for **product feature blocks**
  - Use icons **associated with actions**, and label them (unless no space or icon is 100% clear)
  - Use icons as **bullet points**

- USE ICONS **WELL**
  - To keep icons neutral, **use same color as text**. **Or Different color To draw more attention**,
  - Don’t confuse your users: icons need to make sense and **fit the text or action**!
  - **Don't make icons larger** than what they were designed for. **If needed, enclose them in a shape**

### Minimalist/Simple

Focusses on the essential text content, using small or medium-sized sans-serif black text, lines, and few images and icons.

### Bold/Confident

Makes an impact, by featuring big and bold typography, paired with confident use of big and bright colored blocks.
