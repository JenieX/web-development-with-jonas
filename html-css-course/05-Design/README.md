## Design Ingredients

These rules wil be divided into 10 different areas of web design, each area will have its own many rules. These rules can be applied to any website based on something that we will call the website personality.

### 1. Typography

- USE GOOD **TYPEFACES**
  - Use only **good** and popular **typefaces** and play it safe
  - It’s okay to use just **one typeface** per page! If you want more, limit to 2 typefaces
  - Choose the **right typeface** according to your website personality
- USE GOOD FONT **SIZE AND WEIGHT**
  - When choosing font-sizes, **limit choices**! Use a **“type scale” tool** or other **pre-defined range**
  - Use a font size **between 16px and 32px** for “normal” text
  - For **long text** (like a blog post), try a size of **20px or even bigger**
  - For **headlines**, you can go really big **(50px+)** and bold **(600+)**, depending on personality
  - For any text, **don’t use a font weight under 400** (regular)
- CREATE A GOOD **READING EXPERIENCE**
  - Use less than **75 characters per line**
  - For **normal-sized text**, use a **line height between 1.5 and 2**. For **big text**, go **below 1.5**
  - **Decrease letter spacing in headlines**, if it looks unnatural (this will come from experience)
  - Experiment with all **caps for short titles**. Make them **small** and **bold** and **increase letter-spacing**
  - Usually, **don’t justify text**
  - **Don’t center long text** blocks. Small blocks are fine
