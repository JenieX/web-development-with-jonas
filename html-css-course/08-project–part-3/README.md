## Tips

### Scroll to section

Using the property `href="#cta"` on an anchor element, makes it so that clicking the element would auto-scroll to the element that has the property `id="cta"` on it.

## CSS Properties

### [`scroll-behavior`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scroll-behavior)

  - The scrolling box scrolls in a smooth fashion using a user-agent-defined easing function over a user-agent-defined period of time.
