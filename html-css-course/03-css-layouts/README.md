## Intro

Layout is the way text, images, and other content are placed and arranged on a webpage.

There are three types:

#### 1. Floats

The old way of building layouts of all sizes.

#### 2. Flexbox

Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for laying out items in rows or columns. Items flex to fill additional space and shrink to fit into smaller spaces.

#### 3. Grids

CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional layout system for the web. It lets you lay content out in rows and columns, and has many features that make building complex layouts straightforward.
